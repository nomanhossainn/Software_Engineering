## Software Engineering

This repository contains all the Software Engineering course materials from United International University (UIU). It includes lecture notes, lab exercises, and projects that cover a wide range of topics in modern software development and testing.

# Contents

Web Frameworks: Practical examples and starter projects using popular web frameworks for building scalable applications.

Selenium Testing: Automated browser testing scripts and examples to ensure quality and reliability of web applications.

PHP Development: Backend programming concepts, including form handling, session management, and CRUD operations.

MySQL Database: Database design, query optimization, and integration with PHP for dynamic applications.

# Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide a complete reference for learning and practicing software engineering principles, combining both development and testing. It serves as a resource for:

Building and deploying web-based applications.

Understanding automated testing workflows.

Integrating frontend, backend, and database systems.

# How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/nomanhossainn/Software_Engineering.git


For PHP projects, set up a local server (XAMPP, WAMP, or similar) and place the files in the serverâ€™s root directory.

Import any included .sql files into MySQL to set up the database.

For Selenium tests, ensure you have Python, the required libraries, and a compatible web driver installed.

# Future Enhancements

Add examples of API testing and CI/CD integration.

Include advanced Selenium frameworks like TestNG or PyTest.

Expand documentation on software design patterns and best practices.
